Basic python interpreter in c++, including preparation of exceptions objects. The project demonstrates the use of polymorphism, and data structures belonging to STL.

## Proper Division Into Classes And Functions ##
**Helper.cpp:** Number of static functions that will help during the development.

**Parser.cpp:** Get the command lines and understand their meaning according to their structure. This files contain the main logic of the project

**Exceptions:** Hierarchy of classes that represent the different types of errors that can occur in the system.

**Type.cpp:** The interpreter will need to support some basic types and they will inherit from this class.
